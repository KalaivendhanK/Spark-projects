Applicable taxes for the full device amount charged when device is shipped (or when the device is fulfilled in an Xfinity retail store) and are in addition to the monthly charge.\n\nAny applicable tablet subsidy will be applied monthly to your account over a 24 month period regardless of your purchase of the tablet upfront or through a Device Agreement. \n\nIf the subsidy credit results in a negative monthly balance, accumulated credits will be applied at the end of the Device Agreement term.\n\nIf Xfinity is applying any subsidy to your purchase of a tablet, you will lose the remaining value of the subsidy upon termination of the tablet line. The remaining balance under the Device Agreement (including the remaining subsidy amount) becomes immediately due and payable if there is no remaining line on your Xfinity Mobile account that receives services from Xfinity Mobile and at least one of the following post pay subscriptions are not maintained on the account during the term of the Device Agreement: Xfinty TV, Internet, or Voice; or Xfinity Mobile service is terminated for breach.",
